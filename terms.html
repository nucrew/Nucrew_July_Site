      <strong>2.  NUCREW SERVICES AND PLATFORM.</strong><BR>
      <strong>a.)  Connecting Users.</strong>  Nucrew provides a web-based communications platform which enables Clients and Crews to connect.  &quot;Client(s)&quot; are individuals or businesses seeking to obtain services related to content creation from Crews (all such services, collectively, the "Work Product").  &quot;Crew(s)&quot; are individuals or business seeking to create Work Product for Clients.  Clients and Crews are together referred to as &quot;Users.&quot;  Clients are the clients of Crews, and when the Users agree to the terms set forth between the Users, they form a &quot;Users’ Service Agreement&quot; between the two as set forth in further detail in Section 3 of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMPANY DOES NOT CREATE WORK PRODUCT AND DOES NOT EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS TO CREATE WORK PRODUCT. COMPANY DOES NOT SUPERVISE, DIRECT OR CONTROL A CREW’S WORK OR THE WORK PRODUCT IN ANY MANNER, WHICH CREW HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Site only enables connections between Users for the fulfillment of obtaining and providing services related to the Work Product. Company is not responsible for the performance of Users, nor does it have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Work Product, Crews, Clients, nor of the integrity, responsibility, qualifications or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Users. Company makes no representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the Work Product requested and other services provided by Users identified through the Site whether in public, private, or offline interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>b.)  User Vetting.</strong>  Use of the Nucrew Plaform may require Users to undergo an extensive vetting process, including but not limited to a verification of identity, comprehensive criminal background checks, and using third party services as appropriate. Users hereby give consent to Company to conduct background checks as often as required in compliance with federal and state laws, including, without limitation, the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding Company background checks of Users, Company does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of identity or background check information or any information provided through the Nucrew Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property when interacting with other Users. NEITHER COMPANY NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE NUCREW PLATFORM AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO. COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE NUCREW PLATFORM.
    </p>

      <strong>a.)  Users’ Service Agreement.</strong>  You acknowledge and agree that the Users’ Service Agreement is formed when you agree on the terms of a Work Product with another User. The terms of the Users’ Service Agreement include the terms set forth in this Section 3, the engagement terms proposed and accepted on the Nucrew Platform, and any other contractual terms accepted by both the Client and the Crew to the extent such terms do not conflict with the terms in this Section 3 and do not expand Company’s obligations or restrict Company’s rights under this Agreement. You agree that Company is not a party to any Users’ Service Agreement and the formation of a Users’ Service Agreement will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Company and the Crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where approved in advance by the Client, the Crew is not obligated to personally create the Work Product. Before any Work Product services are performed by any assistants, helpers, subcontractors or other personnel engaged by the Crew, the Crew shall require any such individuals to either become registered Crew on the Nucrew Platform pursuant to Company policies as described on the Nucrew Platform or enter agreements with Crew obligating them to comply with Company policies. The Crew assumes full and sole responsibility for the payment of all compensation, benefits and expenses of helpers, assistants, subcontractors and/or other personnel, if any, and for all required and applicable state and federal income tax withholdings as to the Crew and all persons engaged by the Crew in the performance of the Crew’s services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Client shall pay for completed Work Product through the Company’s payment service provider (&quot;PSP&quot;) as indicated on the Nucrew Platform at the rates agreed to in the engagement terms. Each party agrees to comply with the requisite standard industry rules and regulations during the engagement, performance and completion of a Work Product. Both parties agree to notify Company of any disputes prior to negotiation of or filing of any claims and to negotiate any dispute informally via Company representatives for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any proceeding between the parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>b.)  Independent Contractor Agreement.</strong>  Users’ acceptance of the Users’ Service Agreement (in this subsection, also referred to as &quot;Agreement&quot;) constitutes acceptance that Crew is acting as an independent contractor to Client and all Work Product is wholly owned by Client.  Specifically, in consideration of the mutual benefits and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is acknowledged, Client and Crew agree to the following terms:
    
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Crew may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to Client.

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
       (h)  Waiver.  Any Party's failure to enforce any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions, or prevent that Party thereafter from enforcing each and every other provision of this Agreement.

    </p>
    <p>
      (i) Entire Agreement - Enforceability.  This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all contracts, proposals, oral or written, and all other communications between the Parties with respect of the subject matter hereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>c.)  Worker Classification and Withholdings.</strong>  AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 2, COMPANY DOES NOT PERFORM TASKS AND DOES NOT EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS TO PERFORM TASKS. Each User assumes all liability for proper classification of such User’s workers based on applicable legal guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users do not have authority to enter into written or oral — whether implied or express — contracts on behalf of Company. Each User acknowledges that Company does not, in any way, supervise, direct, or control a Crew’s work or Crew services performed in any manner. Company does not set a Crew’s work hours or location of work. Company will not provide any equipment, labor or materials needed for a particular Work Product. Company does not provide any supervision to Users.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nucrew Platform is not an employment service and Company is not an employer of any User. As such, Company is not responsible for and will not be liable for any tax payments or withholding, including but not limited to unemployment insurance, social security, disability insurance or any other applicable federal or state withholdings in connection with your use of Users’ services.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend Company from any and all claims or liabilities arising from a determination by a court, arbitrator, government agency or other body that a Crew was misclassified as an employee (including, but not limited to, taxes, penalties, interest and attorney’s fees), any claim that Company was an employer or joint employer of a Crew, any claims under any applicable employment-related laws, such as, without limitation, those relating to employment termination, employment discrimination, harassment or retaliation, as well as, without limitation, any claims for unpaid wages, withholdings, overtime pay, failure to provide meal and rest breaks, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement benefits, worker's compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other employee benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4. BILLING AND PAYMENT.</strong><BR>
      Users of the Nucrew Platform contract for Work Product directly with other Users. Company will not be a party to any contracts for Work Products or related services. Payment for Work Product services through the Nucrew Platform is made directly from the Client to the Crew and not by Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users of the Nucrew Platform will be required to provide their credit card or bank account details to Company and the PSP retained by Company. Clients will be responsible for paying any and all invoices for each Work Product (the &quot;Invoices&quot;), which will include (i) the pricing terms of the Work Product agreed with and provided by the Crew (&quot;Crew Payment&quot;), (ii) any out of pocket expenses agreed with and submitted by the Crew in connection with the Work Product, (iii) any tip or gratuity, if applicable, (iv) the service charge Company assesses for the Nucrew Platform, variable based on the Crew Payment amount, and (v) the platform fee, which is used to offset Company's cost of providing User Vetting set forth in Section 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crew may be required to register with the PSP, agree to Terms of Service of the PSP and go through a vetting process at the request of the PSP to set up their account with the PSP. Terms of Service between Crew and the PSP retained by Company are available here (the &quot;PSP Agreement&quot;). By accepting these Terms of Use, each Crew agrees that they have downloaded or printed, and reviewed and agreed to the PSP Agreement. Please note that Company is not a party to the PSP Agreement and that you, the PSP and any other parties listed in the PSP Agreement (currently, Paypal) are the parties to the PSP Agreement and that Company has no obligations or liability to any Crew under the PSP Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Client automatically authorizes Company to provide Client's payment details to the PSP for processing of Crew Payment, out of pocket expenses owed to Crew, and the service charge and platform fees owed to Company for the use of the Nucrew Platform when Company receives confirmation from Client and Crew of engagement (for deposit) and final submission of the Work Product. You may be charged a cancellation fee through the PSP if you book a Work Product, but cancel it before it is completed, as set forth in the Work Product pricing terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but not the obligation), upon request from Client or Crew or upon notice of any potential fraud, unauthorized charges or other misuse of the Nucrew Platform, to (i) place on hold any Crew Payment and out of pocket expenses, or (ii) refund, provide credits or arrange for the PSP to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crew Payment and fees must be paid through the PSP as indicated on the Nucrew Platform. 
      Users of the Nucrew Platform will be liable for any taxes (including VAT, if applicable) required to be paid on the Work Product services provided under the Users’ Service Agreement (other than taxes on Company’s income).
    </p>
    <p>
