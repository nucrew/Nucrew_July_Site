<b>FAQ</b></font> <br><br>
 <font class="TSS2a">
<b>What is Nucrew ?</b><br>
Nucrew is a fresh approach to hiring filmmakers and photographers to create branded content. Book talent seamlessly through our app or online in a matter of minutes, instead spending valuable time coordinating shoots.  We specialize in quick turn-around schedules, short-form, web and social content, including commercials, promos, daily news, mini docs, and behind the scenes. We empower brands to tell their story and engage with their customers and community across multiple distribution channels. <br><br>

Our team of award winning filmmakers, producers, and marketers has deep reaching relationships to some of the most esteemed crew members - in advertising, film, fashion, and journalism - that you can now have access to in a few clicks, as well as super fast content creators that have mastered the iPhone.  Nucrew delivers quality content that helps brands optimize their marketing reach on a daily basis. <br><br>
 
<b>Do crew members work for Nucrew?</b><br>
Crew members are vetted independent contractors and production companies who work for themselves.  Nucrew is a platform to connect businesses with professional crew - immediately and conveniently.  Nucrew vets all individuals and/or companies before accepting them to ensure they are professional and reliable resources for our clients. <br><br>
 
<b>How is Nucrew talent selected?</b><br>
Our Nucrew team consists of award-winning filmmakers and producers and our network is made up a select, highly vetted, and curated group of filmmakers, editors, photographers and other industry talent. <br><br>
 
<b>How do I book a job?</b><br>
First, you'll need to set up your account, select the type of service you're interested, indicate the date and location you are looking to shoot, and write or email us a creative brief with job requirements, and voila, we'll connect you to our available professionals that meet your criteria, along with pricing. <br><br>
 
<b>How do I know when a Nucrew member is available?</b><br>
Nucrew minimizes the effort required to find crew available on the day you're looking to shoot. You will have selection of talent to choose from to make your shoot a success.   For our next phase, we will be rolling out automated matching based on dates requested.  <br><br>
 
<b>How do I manage my job?</b><br>
If you are hiring us for a package, It will be important to include any schedule of deliverables in your job notes or creative brief before the shoot date to ensure the crew members are made aware of all deadlines.  You may email .pdf creative briefs to <a href="mailto:production@nucrew.com">production@nucrew.com</a>.  Please include your Job ID# in the subject line.   After the shoot, you will be invited to a private folder on Frame.io, a video review and collaboration tool, where you will collaborate with Nucrew on the final deliverables.  After final payment is received, a private download link will be made available.  If you are simply requesting un-edited video camera files, these will be available for download immediately after payment is received. <br><br>
 
<b>How is payment handled?</b><br>
At launch we are using Paypal to handle our transactions.  Jobs are billed 50% of the fee upfront and 50% once the final files are complete and ready to be delivered.  Final payment must be received before final files are delivered.
<br><br>
 
<b>How do I cancel a job? Are there cancellation penalties?</b><br>
If a client needs to cancel a job, then they must send an email to <a href="mailto:help@nucrew.com">help@nucrew.com</a> indicating the reason for cancellation. Upon confirmation of any job, an advance payment fee of 50% of the total cost is paid to the crew member through Nucrew. If the shoot is cancelled 5 days or more prior to shoot date, the client will pay up to 50% of the Service Fee. If the shoot is cancelled less than 5 days prior to shoot day, the client will be responsible for 100% of fees and their account will be billed accordingly.  In the event of cancellation or postponement of the booking for any cause other than the crew members, client shall forfeit the 50% deposit.
<br><br>
 
<b>Can I edit my job requirements or creative brief once it's been posted?</b><br>
It is expected that creative briefs and shoot dates will be final before posting for a service. However, this is production and we understand that requirements can change based on new brand direction and timing.  In the event that there are any changes, please email us and we can check with our crew to make sure new requests can be accommodated. We will always do our best to work with you and the process as seamless as possible.  If there are significant changes to scope, Nucrew will provide adjusted pricing that would need to be approved prior to the shoot date. <br><br>


<b>What are the final delivery formats for jobs requested?</b><br>
Unless otherwise requested, all final edited videos will be 1080p HD .mp4 files.  If you need a ProRes file for broadcast, just ask.  If you are requesting un-edited camera files, the file type depends on the camera being used (eg. Canon, Sony, Red, iPhone).  Please email us with your Job ID# if you need specific information at <a href="mailto:production@nucrew.com">production@nucrew.com</a>. <br><br>

Final formats for photography are .jpg for social packages and hi-rez .jpg and .tiff for editorial/portrait shoots.
 
 <br><br>

<b>What if there is an issue with a crew member showing up?</b><br>
